# outlier-aware-histogram
Used for robustly plotting histograms of data with outliers in Python.

Check the notebook for usage and code.

Inspired by [Edwin Theon](https://edwinth.github.io/blog/outlier-bin/). Uses MAD (median of absolute deviations) to estimate the standard deviation (explanation [here](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/07/29/outlier-methods-external/outlier-methods-external.pdf)).
